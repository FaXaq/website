In the world of music notation editors, there is plenty to chose from. From [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/) and [Sibelius](https://www.avid.com/sibelius) to [Impro-Visor](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~keller/jazz/improvisor/). I am teaching guitar and now in a position where I have to create music sheets for my students and myself. I was searching for a software easy to use from where I can share notes and scores. There are a few possibilities, but I was looking for a free software that all my students can use. There was the open source [MuseScore](https://musescore.org/) but that would have required students to install it. So I went searching for an online solution and found two : [Soundslice](https://www.soundslice.com/) & [noteflight](https://www.noteflight.com/). 

As you may have guessed from the title of this article I went for Soundslice. I prefer its user experience. It's sunch a pleasure writing and sharing scores on this tool and the possibility to syncronise a video with it (for tutorial or transcription) is genius. For instnace, here is my transcription of a [chord changes video](https://youtu.be/EkzQ8vivejE) inspired by neosoul genre.
