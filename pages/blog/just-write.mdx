  For the last years, I've been wondering about writing, or at least about its purpose : organizing and developing thoughts. Not that I am an avid thinker, maybe more an avid dreamer. But here I am, dreaming and dreaming without writing things down and I feel like being inside an endless loop.

  A few days ago, I stumbled upon : [https://100daystooffload.com/](https://100daystooffload.com/) and I'm thinking, why not ?

  > Just. Write.

  I like the simplicity it yells. It kind of speak to me like this :

  > Write. You will find what to write about, and by writing you will think about it.

  Just like that, I selected a few topics I want to write about. Even though I am not sure of the format each one will take, here are  topics I want to offload on :

  - Cycling
  - Guitar
  - Politics (yeah I know... but hey, I like politics)
  - Developing ideas
  - Programming
  - Readings
  - Other articles
  - Achievements
  - Teaching
  - Empathy
  - ... and probably more


  This may not be the technical personal blog I was thinking about, but I like the idea of re-centering myself on what matters to me and during that process analyse and develop my thoughts on each topic.

  Just by writing this blog post I already defined what I want this blog to be for me : _an outlet that helps me organize my thoughts_.

  To this blog post and probably some more,

  Cheers
