Internet is full of information. True. False. Biased. Opiniated. Subjective. Organized. Disorganized.

While there are some projects like Wikipedia, which thrives at organizing by generating data, there is a tool that fascinates me : [https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/). This extension that proves it is possible to organize and retrieve data from a web page and by extending it, modify directly what the user see.

The simplicity with wich it enables data enhancement, building on what is already in the webpage is glorious. It reminds me to a certain extent of what I thought possible with the [Giant Global Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_Global_Graph) and the Web 3.0 of the [Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web).

_Note to myself: I should make a post about it too..._
