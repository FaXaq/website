Internet is full of information. True. False. Biased. Opiniated. Subjective. Organized. Disorganized.

While there are some projects like Wikipedia, which thrives at organizing by generating data, there is a tool that my mentor sent me : [https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/) that fascinates me. This magic tool is a simple extension that proves it is possible to organize and retrieve data from a web page and extending it, modifying directly what the user see.

On the fly it allows to :
- Extract data
- Model it
- Extend it
- Modify it


I have not yet wrapped my mind on what paths it can open, but I'm sure those are immense.
