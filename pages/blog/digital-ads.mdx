  After 5 years I disabled my ad blocker and I was shocked by how much advertising there is on the web, most importantly on content creators' platforms. I watch videos, listen to podcasts, look at stream replays and on every single of those platforms, advertising took a huge place. More than I remember. Is my mind playing me tricks ?

  Last November, nobody missed YouTube ToS updates [1], with the now famous :

  > For channels not yet in the YouTube Partner Program:We added this new section to let you know that, starting today weâ€™ll begin slowly rolling out ads on a limited number of videos from channels not in YPP (Youtube Partner Program).

  It seems that while for several years YouTube (and other CC platforms) has been keen to accept new content creators for free, without showing ads on every video, it rolls out a new advertising strategy. This strategy rings like : "Monetise your videos, or we will do it anyway.". In my opinion, it takes place after two major changes :

  - The birth and stabilization of services like [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/) and [Tipeee](https://en.tipeee.com/).
  - In content advertising (product placement).

  Those services takes care creators' need of a stable revenue stream by enabling its community financial engagement. By enabling this other income source, need of ads revenue from the platforms dwindles more and more coupled with in content product placements. This is those two streams that allows creators to remove YouTube ads from their channels, and enforce YouTube to add ads on every video.

  YouTube has been in the game for a long time. But what about others ? And what's different from TV at this point ? I fear that while we've gain the content customization we tend to an advertising normalization to support platforms and then, content creators.

  Why is advertising taking so much place, and our attention with that matter ? Isn't there a more profitable model for Content Creators, Content Platforms and Content Consumers ?

  There is a way, and it is for the consumer to pay. But pay every plaftorm ? It is not ideal, can be expansive and in my opinion tend to a content normalization and most importantly, centralisation. Centralisation because Content Creators needs audience, and audience is provided by the platform, and the plaftorm is here.
