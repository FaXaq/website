Those are the two most popular rythm structures in contemporary music. They are not opposed but rather complementary.

Each musician will have its own definition but if we try to do it academicaly we could say:
> A binary rythm section is when the quarter note value is divisble by 2. A ternary rythm section is when the quarter note value is divisible by 3.

A quarter note value means its duration, but ternary and binary are not related to tempo at all.

After a few years, to me it comes down to two things:
- Binary is a base. Everything is divisible by 2. It always feels the same.
- Ternary is more of a feel thing. It feels _different_. Not better, not worse. Just _different_.

I'll try to define this _different_.

Let's take a horse for example.
- When it trots you can count like this : 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, ...
  - 1: HL _(horse legs)_ rear right and HL front left, cavalier raises
  - 2: HL rear left and HL front right, cavalier seats
- When it gallops you can count like this (ommiting the two) : 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, ....
  - 1: HL rear left
  - 2: HL rear right and HL front left
  - 3: HL front right

The feel on those horse gaits is really different, but both can be quicker than the other it all comes down to preference and terrain, exactly like in music. It's preferable to be able to do both, but when you're with others, you have to be at the same gait.
