  // the "error" in the abscissa. Well x1,x2,x3 should be y1,y2,y3 because they are the ordinates.
  // ----
  // Note: x1, x2 and x3 were the previous names of y1, y2 and y3
  // ----
  // From me:
  // What I can comprehend on this, is that we have a parabolic equation, but are unsure which of those three points
  // is the closest to our desired frequency. This bits sorts it out by comparing which is closer to the parabolic 
  // peak.
