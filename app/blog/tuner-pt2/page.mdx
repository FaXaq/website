## Let's take a step back

Last time I said I had to try [Autocorrelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation) in order to guess a note from an audio input. To explain this principle, I need to come back on a few things. I forgot to mention that we can represent frequencies as sine waves. For instance, here is how we could represent a frequency of 440Hz :

<ClearSineWave />

But most of the time, a sound is a sum of frequencies, for instance if we combine A4 (440Hz) and C#5 (554.37Hz), it looks like this : 

<SineWaveWithMultipleFrequencies />

As notes are louder or quieter, their frequency amplitudes differ. For instance, if A has 4 times more amplitude than C#, it results in a sine wave looking like this : 

<SineWaveWithSumOfFrequenciesDifferentAmplitudes />

As you can see, a frequency is a [pattern replicated within each period](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/amplitude-period-frequency-phase-shift.html). Previously we relied on `getByteFrequencyData` from the analyser to get frequencies in bins of `1.46484375Hz`. But this led us to nothing. What we will do now, is access the sound information at a given time and verify if it repeats within a period. With this period we will then be able to calculate our main frequency : `frequency = 1/period`.

Remember when I said that frequencies are sine waves ? This is where is comes handy. By offsetting it gradually we can verify if it repeats.

__Here is a proof of concept :__

  <MatchingSinWaves />

You will probably find that the frequency is around 450Hz, it's due to rendering but anyway, it's close to our 440Hz, so, you get the idea !

## Let's build the tuner

First, I prefer to extract the logic to create our analyser inside a hook and use it on demand :

export const file1 = {
  code:`
export const FFT_SIZE = 32768

export function useAnalyser(stream: MediaStream, fftSize: number = FFT_SIZE): [] | [AnalyserNode, MediaStreamAudioSourceNode] {
  if (!stream ) {
    return []
  }
  const ctx = new AudioContext()
  const analyser = ctx.createAnalyser()
  analyser.fftSize = fftSize
  analyser.minDecibels = -100;
  analyser.maxDecibels = -10;
  analyser.smoothingTimeConstant = 0.85;
  const sourceNode = ctx.createMediaStreamSource(stream)
  sourceNode.connect(analyser)
  return [analyser, sourceNode]
}`,
language: "tsx",
title: "hooks/useAnalyser.tsx"
}

<CodeBlock file={file1} />

Then invoke the hook and create a function to start using our tuner extract timebased data from our analyser. It will use a setInterval that we can stop when we later want the tuner to stop. 

export const file2 = {
  code:`
const TunerContainer = ({ audioStream }: TunerContainerProps) => {
  const [analyser] = useAnalyser(audioStream, 2048)

  function start() {
    if (analyser) {
      const interval = setInterval(() => {
        const buffer = new Float32Array(analyser.fftSize)
        analyser.getFloatTimeDomainData(buffer)
        // This will be where we run our autoCorrelate function to guess the frequency
      }, 500) as unknown as number
      setGuessingInterval(interval)
    }
  }

  return <></>
}
`,
language: "tsx",
title: "components/TunerContainer.tsx"
}

<CodeBlock file={file2} />

We then use this wonderful function made for us by a [PhD student](https://github.com/cwilso/PitchDetect/pull/23), rewritten for reading purposes :

export const file3 = {
code:`
// Thanks to
// https://github.com/cwilso/PitchDetect/pull/23
// https://github.com/dalatant
// https://alexanderell.is/posts/tuner/

// https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square
function getRootMeanSquare(buffer: Float32Array) {
  let sum = 0
  for (let i = 0; i < buffer.length; i++) {
    sum += buffer[i] * buffer[i]
  }
  return Math.sqrt(sum / buffer.length)
}

function buildBufferWithThreshold(buffer: Float32Array) {
  // Since the main sound is a sum of frequencies it can be seen as a composed sine wave
  // We can predict that it will repeat, so we can narrow the buffer down, to several occurences with a threshold
  let r1 = 0;
  let r2 = buffer.length - 1;
  let thres = 0.2;

  // Split buffer un half and check where we lose frequency amplitude so we can work on less data 
  for (let i = 0; i < buffer.length / 2; i++) {
    if (Math.abs(buffer[i]) < thres) {
      r1 = i;
      break;
    }
  }

  for (let i = 1; i < buffer.length / 2; i++) {
    if (Math.abs(buffer[buffer.length - i]) < thres) {
      r2 = buffer.length - i;
      break;
    }
  }

  return buffer.slice(r1, r2)
}

// Implements the ACF2+ algorithm
export function autoCorrelate(buffer: Float32Array, sampleRate: number) {
  // Calculate the root mean square to see if we have enough signal to perform operations
  let rootMeanSquare = getRootMeanSquare(buffer)

  if (rootMeanSquare < 0.01) {
    return -1;
  }

  const newBuffer = buildBufferWithThreshold(buffer)

  // Build correlation array containing ordinates values multiplied by a moving offset.
  // The index that will have the greater value will be the peak of our sine wave
  let correlation = new Array(newBuffer.length).fill(0);
  for (let i = 0; i < newBuffer.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < newBuffer.length-i; j++) {
      correlation[i] += newBuffer[j] * newBuffer[j+i];
    }
  }

  let d = 0;

  // Find the first bottom within our new range
  while (correlation[d] > correlation[d + 1]) {
    d++;
  }

  let maxVal = -1
  let maxPos = -1;

  // From that index find the first peak within the correlation array, our desired abscissa
  for (var i = d; i < newBuffer.length; i++) {
    if (correlation[i] > maxVal) {
      maxVal = correlation[i];
      maxPos = i;
    }
  }
  var T0 = maxPos;

  // From the original author:
  // interpolation is parabolic interpolation. It helps with precision. We suppose that a parabola pass through the
  // three points that comprise the peak. 'a' and 'b' are the unknowns from the linear equation system and b/(2a) is
  // the "error" in the abscissa. Well x1,x2,x3 should be y1,y2,y3 because they are the ordinates.
  // ----
  // Note: x1, x2 and x3 were the previous names of y1, y2 and y3
  // ----
  // From me:
  // What I can comprehend on this, is that we have a parabolic equation, but are unsure which of those three points
  // is the closest to our desired frequency. This bits sorts it out by comparing which is closer to the parabolic 
  // peak.
  let y1 = correlation[T0 - 1]
  let y2 = correlation[T0]
  let y3 = correlation[T0 + 1];

  let a = (y1 + y3 - 2 * y2) / 2;
  let b = (y3 - y1) / 2;
  if (a) {
    T0 = T0 - b / (2 * a);
  }

  return sampleRate / T0;
}`,
language: "typescript",
title: "helpers/autoCorrelate.ts"
}

<CodeBlock file={file3} />

It may seem complicated but it only is what I was writing about before. Calculate the autocorrelation, finding it's first peak, and boom, we have our __period__. We then just add it to our `start` function. Let's also create a stop function :

export const file4 = {
  code:`
const TunerContainer = ({ audioStream }: TunerContainerProps) => {
  const [analyser] = useAnalyser(audioStream, 2048)
  const [guessedFrequency, setGuessedFrequency] = useState(-1)

  function stop() {
    clearInterval(guessingInterval)
  }

  function start() {
    if (analyser) {
      const interval = setInterval(() => {
        const buffer = new Float32Array(analyser.fftSize)
        analyser.getFloatTimeDomainData(buffer)
        setGuessedFrequency(autoCorrelate(buffer, analyser.context.sampleRate))
      }, 500) as unknown as number
      setGuessingInterval(interval)
    }
  }

  return <>
    <p>{guessedFrequency}</p>
    <button onClick={() => start()}>start</button>
    <button onClick={() => stop()}>stop</button>
  </>
}
`,
language: "tsx",
title: "components/TunerContainer.tsx"
}

<CodeBlock file={file4} addedLineNumbers={[2,4,5,6,19,20,21,22,23]} />

That's it, we have a tuner, that every 500ms will take the sound input and guess its main pitch.

## The process explained with charts

At a given time, we extract our timebased values, notice how there is 2048 values, it's our FFT_SIZE :

<BufferVisualiser />

We filter values that are above a specific threshold. Well, it doesn't do that much in our case, but anyway :

<NewBufferVisualiser />

We calculate correlation for each abscissa :

<CorrelationVisualiser />

And we find our period :

<CorrelationVisualiserWithPeriod />

We have a period of 401, but our sample rate is 44100 samples per second. What remains is dividing our sample rate by our period, to obtain our desired frequency : `44100 / 401 = 109.975062344Hz`. Which is really close to the frequency of an A string on a guitar : `110.0Hz` ! This is the string I plucked for the test. It means that it works, and I am in tune, just barely barely flat !

## What if we want to use it to tune a guitar ?

Well, that was the purpose of this whole experiment.
Let's use [MTTS](https://github.com/faxaq/mtts) to generate an array containing tuning notes for our guitar. It is a library that I created to manipulate music theory conceps in typescript. We can use it to easily create notes, scales, chords, etc. :

export const file5 = {
  code:`

import { Note } from "mtts"

const notes = [
  Note.fromSPN('E2'),
  Note.fromSPN('A2'),
  Note.fromSPN('D3'),
  Note.fromSPN('G3'),
  Note.fromSPN('B3'),
  Note.fromSPN('E4'),
]

const TunerContainer = ({ audioStream }: TunerContainerProps) => {
  const [analyser] = useAnalyser(audioStream, 2048)
  const [guessedFrequency, setGuessedFrequency] = useState(-1)

  function stop() {
    clearInterval(guessingInterval)
  }

  function start() {
    if (analyser) {
      const interval = setInterval(() => {
        const buffer = new Float32Array(analyser.fftSize)
        analyser.getFloatTimeDomainData(buffer)
        setGuessedFrequency(autoCorrelate(buffer, analyser.context.sampleRate))
      }, 500) as unknown as number
      setGuessingInterval(interval)
    }
  }

  return <>
    <p>{guessedFrequency}</p>
    <button onClick={() => start()}>start</button>
    <button onClick={() => stop()}>stop</button>
  </>
}
`,
language: "tsx",
title: "components/TunerContainer.tsx"
}

<CodeBlock file={file5} addedLineNumbers={[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]} />

We now have an array containing notes to test our guesssed frequency against. Let's create a function that recursively take a frequency and an array of notes and returns the note with the closest frequency and add it to a react state.

export const file6 = {
  code:`

import { Note } from "mtts"

const notes = [
  Note.fromSPN('E2'),
  Note.fromSPN('A2'),
  Note.fromSPN('D3'),
  Note.fromSPN('G3'),
  Note.fromSPN('B3'),
  Note.fromSPN('E4'),
]

function findClosestNote(searchedFrequency: number, notesInRange: Note[]): Note {
  if (notesInRange.length <= 3) {
    let noteFound = notesInRange[0]
    let closest = Math.abs(searchedFrequency - noteFound.frequency)
    for (let i = 1; i < notesInRange.length; i++) {
      const frequencyDifference = Math.abs(searchedFrequency - notesInRange[i].frequency)
      if (closest > frequencyDifference) {
        noteFound = notesInRange[i]
        closest = frequencyDifference
      }
    }
    return noteFound
  }

  const secondHalf = notesInRange.slice(notesInRange.length / 2, notesInRange.length)

  if (searchedFrequency < secondHalf[0].frequency) {
    return findClosestNote(searchedFrequency, notesInRange.slice(0, (notesInRange.length / 2) + 1))
  }

  return  findClosestNote(searchedFrequency, notesInRange.slice((notesInRange.length / 2) - 1, notesInRange.length))
}

const TunerContainer = ({ audioStream }: TunerContainerProps) => {
  const [analyser] = useAnalyser(audioStream, 2048)
  const [guessedFrequency, setGuessedFrequency] = useState(-1)
  const [guessedNote, setGuessedNote] = useState<Note>()

  useEffect(() => {
    if (guessedFrequency > 0) {
      setGuessedNote(findClosestNote(guessedFrequency, notes))
    } else {
      setGuessedNote(undefined)
    }

    return undefined
  }, [setGuessedNote, guessedFrequency])

  function stop() {
    clearInterval(guessingInterval)
  }

  function start() {
    if (analyser) {
      const interval = setInterval(() => {
        const buffer = new Float32Array(analyser.fftSize)
        analyser.getFloatTimeDomainData(buffer)
        setGuessedFrequency(autoCorrelate(buffer, analyser.context.sampleRate))
      }, 500) as unknown as number
      setGuessingInterval(interval)
    }
  }

  return <>
    <p>{guessedFrequency}</p>
    <p>{guessedNote?.SPN}</p>
    <button onClick={() => start()}>start</button>
    <button onClick={() => stop()}>stop</button>
  </>
}
`,
language: "tsx",
title: "components/TunerContainer.tsx"
}

<CodeBlock file={file6} addedLineNumbers={[11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,37,28,39,40,41,42,43,44,66]} removedLineNumbers={[65]} />

And use it on our frequency inside our component : 

Just to wrap it up, we add wheter our frequency is flat or sharp to our closest note. To avoid testing against a fixed frequency, that is impossible to have on a guitar, we add a margin of `0.3Hz`.

```ts
```

export const file7 = {
  code:`

import { Note } from "mtts"

const AVERAGE_FLUCTUATION = 0.3

const notes = [
  Note.fromSPN('E2'),
  Note.fromSPN('A2'),
  Note.fromSPN('D3'),
  Note.fromSPN('G3'),
  Note.fromSPN('B3'),
  Note.fromSPN('E4'),
]

function findClosestNote(searchedFrequency: number, notesInRange: Note[]): Note {
  if (notesInRange.length <= 3) {
    let noteFound = notesInRange[0]
    let closest = Math.abs(searchedFrequency - noteFound.frequency)
    for (let i = 1; i < notesInRange.length; i++) {
      const frequencyDifference = Math.abs(searchedFrequency - notesInRange[i].frequency)
      if (closest > frequencyDifference) {
        noteFound = notesInRange[i]
        closest = frequencyDifference
      }
    }
    return noteFound
  }

  const secondHalf = notesInRange.slice(notesInRange.length / 2, notesInRange.length)

  if (searchedFrequency < secondHalf[0].frequency) {
    return findClosestNote(searchedFrequency, notesInRange.slice(0, (notesInRange.length / 2) + 1))
  }

  return  findClosestNote(searchedFrequency, notesInRange.slice((notesInRange.length / 2) - 1, notesInRange.length))
}

const TunerContainer = ({ audioStream }: TunerContainerProps) => {
  const [analyser] = useAnalyser(audioStream, 2048)
  const [guessedFrequency, setGuessedFrequency] = useState(-1)
  const [guessedNote, setGuessedNote] = useState<Note>()

  useEffect(() => {
    if (guessedFrequency > 0) {
      setGuessedNote(findClosestNote(guessedFrequency, notes))
    } else {
      setGuessedNote(undefined)
    }

    return undefined
  }, [setGuessedNote, guessedFrequency])

  function stop() {
    clearInterval(guessingInterval)
  }

  function start() {
    if (analyser) {
      const interval = setInterval(() => {
        const buffer = new Float32Array(analyser.fftSize)
        analyser.getFloatTimeDomainData(buffer)
        setGuessedFrequency(autoCorrelate(buffer, analyser.context.sampleRate))
      }, 500) as unknown as number
      setGuessingInterval(interval)
    }
  }

  const inTune = Math.abs(guessedFrequency - guessedNote?.frequency) < AVERAGE_FLUCTUATION
  const sharp = Math.abs(guessedFrequency - guessedNote?.frequency) > AVERAGE_FLUCTUATION && (guessedFrequency - guessedNote?.frequency) > 0
  const flat = Math.abs(guessedFrequency - guessedNote?.frequency) > AVERAGE_FLUCTUATION && (guessedFrequency - guessedNote?.frequency) < 0

  <>
    { inTune && <p>it's a flat...</p> }
    <p>{guessedNote?.SPN}</p>
    { inTune && <p>in tune !</p> }
    { sharp && <p>...but it's sharp</p> }
    <button onClick={() => start()}>start</button>
    <button onClick={() => stop()}>stop</button>

}
`,
language: "tsx",
title: "components/TunerContainer.tsx"
}

<CodeBlock file={file7} addedLineNumbers={[2,66,67,68,71,73,74]} />

And here we have our tuner :
