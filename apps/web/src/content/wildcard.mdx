Internet is full of information. True. False. Biased. Opiniated. Subjective. Organized. Disorganized.

While there are some projects like Wikipedia, which thrives at organizing by generating data, there is a tool that fascinates me : [https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/wildcard/). This extension that proves it is possible to organize and retrieve data from a web page and by extending it, modify directly what the user see.

The simplicity with wich it enables data enhancement, building on what is already in the webpage is glorious.
